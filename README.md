Project Summary:

This project is a cloud-based portfolio built as part of the Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal. It showcases various AWS services and development skills acquired during the process. The portfolio includes a static website hosted on Amazon S3, secured with HTTPS using CloudFront and Route 53. It features a JavaScript visitor counter, with visitor count data stored in DynamoDB and accessed via an API deployed on AWS Lambda. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and a CI/CD pipeline is established with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
